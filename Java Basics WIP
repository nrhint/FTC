// Putting text on screen.
// Printing text. Printing text in java is pretty simple. You can print in quotation marks. 
// Make sure you put a semi colon at the end of a Command so it knows to stop at that point.
// Numbers dont need to be in quotes.

System.out.print( "Hello" );
System.out.print(52);

// There are 2 kinds of printing in Java. You can do System.out.print(2 + 2); and System.out.println(2 + 2); . The difference between them is that if you use 
// System.out.println();, It will print true or false and then, all the code after it will print onto the next line. (ln = Line).

System.out.println(1 + 1);

// Integer or int
// An integer is a number stored as a value. If 1 + 2 = 3, 3 is the integer. It is not as confusing as it sounds.
// Integers dont need to be typed in quotes. They are numbers. An integer can only be a number between -2,147,483,647 and 2,147,483,647.
// If you put a number or problem in quotes, it will print out whatever you typed inbetween those quotes.

System.out.print(2 + 10);
System.out.print(-2147483647 + 2147483647);

// Booleans
// A boolean can only be true or false. Or on and off. Or 1 or 0. Its either true or false.

System.out.print(true);

// Char
// A char can only be a Single letter in Single quotes.

System.out.print('g');

// Variables
// Variables are very common in Java. A variable stores a value. You can make something a Integer, Boolean, or a Char. These are all valid types of variables
// Make sure you put the kind of variables that it is (Boolean, Int, or Char) before you assign it.\
// This function stores a value that you can use later down the line. So for instance, myNumber1 + myNumber2. You can do this and other stuff in Java

int number = 6;
int myNumber = 7;
boolean iAmCool = true;
char movieRating = 'G';

// Comments.
// Comments (As you can see here) are things that humans are meant to read. The computer does nothing to whatevery I type after the 2 slashes.
// if you want a multi-line comment you to a /* and end it with a */ . Eveyrthing typed in a comment is not looked at by java.

// Math.
// Math can be used in a lot of ways. Addtion +, Subraction -, Multiplication *, and Division /.
// These can all be used in a bunch of ways.

int sum = 23 + 54;
int difference = 202 - 91;
int product = 2 * 8;
int quotient = 15 / 3;

// Another instance of doing math is adding Integers together.

int myOtherNumber = number + myNumber;

System.out.print(myOtherNumber);

// More Math
// We have a Modulo. A modulo is basically a remainder. So for instance 15 % 6 would give you the answer of 3 because 6 goes into 15 2 times with a remainder of 3.

int myModulo = 15 % 6;

// This kind of falls under tha category of math so I thought I would put it here

// Relational Operators
// Relational Operators are basically greater then or less than. It makes sense when you see it. Here are the symbols used. <, >, <=, and >= .
// It prints a true or false value.
// You dont need to use System.out.println(); here, I just do it for the simplicity.

System.out.println(5 < 7);
System.out.println(8 > 4);
System.out.println(9 >= 10);
System.out.println(11 <= 12);

// You can also make use of these symbols with Booleans.

boolean myRO = number <= myOtherNumber;
System.out.print(myRO);

// Equality Operators
// Still in the math category here. WE have Equality Operators. Equality Operators compare things. == Means equal to. != Means not equal to.

boolean myEO = myModulo == myNumber;
System.out.print(myEO);
