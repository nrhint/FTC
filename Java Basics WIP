// Putting text on screen.
// Printing text. Printing text in java is pretty simple. You can print in quotation marks. 
// Make sure you put a semi colon at the end of a Command so it knows to stop at that point.
// Numbers dont need to be in quotes.

System.out.print( "Hello" );
System.out.print(52);

// Integer or int
// An integer is a number stored as a value. If 1 + 2 = 3, 3 is the integer. It is not as confusing as it sounds.
// Integers dont need to be typed in quotes. They are numbers. An integer can only be a number between -2,147,483,647 and 2,147,483,647.

System.out.print(2 + 10);
System.out.print(-2147483647 + 2147483647);

// Booleans
// A boolean can only be true or false. Or on and off. Or 1 or 0. Its either true or false.

System.out.print(true);

// Char
// A char can only be a Single letter in Single quotes.

System.out.print('g');

// Variables
// Variables are very common in Java. A variable stores a value. You can make something a Integer, Boolean, or a Char. These are all valid types of variables
// Make sure you put the kind of variables that it is (Boolean, Int, or Char) before you assign it.\
// This function stores a value that you can use later down the line. So for instance, myNumber1 + myNumber2. You can do this and other stuff in Java

int myNumber = 7;
boolean iAmCool = true;
char movieRating = 'G';
