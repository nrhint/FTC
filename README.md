I am appending data from the top down.  The most recent things are at the top.

Downloaded all the files...


I rewired all the motors to the left are 0-2 , the right are 3-5 and the arm is 6
Now the program works and I have fixed the dirrections.


PROBLEM:
the wheels dont turn the same way when turning or driving

SOLUTION:
I think that the motors are set to the wrong motors.


The ratio from deg to inches is 7.5 deg = 1 inch
360deg turn = 48 inches

360deg turn <60<120<360
450deg = 60 inches


Fixed one problem: the wheels were not all turning the same way.


Working on making the robot turn.  I think that some of the motors are turning backwards when I am trying to turn.  My goall is to turn 90 degrees consistiently.


This is the read me file for FTC.
