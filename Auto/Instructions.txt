This is what I have done to setup the auto code and make t work hopefuly.  I installed Android studio in the home dirrectory of my computer.  I went to https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app to download the sdk fot FTC.  Now I need to figure out how to load it into Android studio.

1. I extracted the file to Home/Android.
2. I imported it with the startup screen of Android Studio.
3. You can also import it through the menu of the main application through  File > New > Import Project.

Here are some links that I used:

Starting a project with this video as a guide:

Created AutoCode folder under ftc_app-master


Looking at the code from the sample I think that I could have done the programing in the ap itself.  I will look into this now.

Also it looks like using a state machine will be the best way or at least learning how to define and call sub functions in java will be useful.


This will work.  I am uploading a program called AtomTest to git and this willl have a basic program.
